## SharkTrust Portal Installation Instructions

SharkTrust is an advanced tool that typically requires initial
consultation provided by Real Time Logic. Contact us for scheduling an
initial consultation. A Linux installation manual suitable for an
experienced Linux administrator can be purchased from Real Time Logic.

### Automatic Installation

[SharkTrustX](https://github.com/RealTimeLogic/SharkTrustX) and SharkTrust have the same installation dependencies and the [SharkTrustX Ansible installation script](https://github.com/RealTimeLogic/SharkTrustXInstaller) can also be used for installing SharkTrust. However, the repository name must be changed from SharkTrustX to SharkTrust in the Ansible installation script.
